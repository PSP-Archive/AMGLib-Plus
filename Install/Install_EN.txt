To install this library, just copy the contents of "include" and "lib" folders to your PSP environment
path (PSPSDK environment variable).

Example: if PSPSDK points to C:\devkitPro\devkitPSP\psp\sdk, then you have to copy (updating if 
it is necessary), "include" and "lib" folders to the "sdk" one.

Once you did it, you can compile examples just to see how the lib works, although you can start 
your own project. You can pick up the "Examples/Template" folder as a template to start it.
